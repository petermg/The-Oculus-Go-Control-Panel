# The Oculus Go Control Panel
Internal ADB Utility with a web GUI for the Oculus Go
Install this on your Oculus Go, which must be in developer / debug mode first.
Then issue the command "adb tcpip 5555" which enables adb over port 5555 via TCPIP, and you must run this command once after every reboot for this application to function.
Then in your Oculus Go, go to UNKNOWN SOURCES and click on "Oculus Go Control Penal". The first time it runs it will prompt you to allow USB debugging. Make sure you have checked the checkmark box and then click ALWAYS ALLOW.. Then a webpage on your device will open up and you can see the available options.

This is what the page looks like and shows what it does:

After you make a selection it will open a new page to indicate if it was successfully. Please let me know if you find any problems by opening an issue here or joining my discord server at https://discord.gg/PPgbApG
